    details: We encourage and build themes that are as customisable as possible. Gone are the days of hoping a manufacturer adds a good looking theme in an update. You can even make your own very easily.

    details: We respect your privacy and do our best to not infringe on it. Themes have very limited access to your system and beofre being on the Theme Store, they are vetted to ensure they won't attempt disrespecting your right to privacy.
