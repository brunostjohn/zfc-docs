# What are themes?

In short, themes are webpages with their own HTML, CSS, and JS served by a webserver embedded into the app.

## Table of Contents

## What can they do?

Themes can do a whole lot of stuff. Apart from doing almost everything a normal webpage can do, they can also do the following:

- Access system sensors (CPU temperatures, GPU clocks, etc.).
- Access user-controllable settings.

## The theme folder structure

For the app to fully understand what your theme is, it needs a few files.

```
.
└── Zefir's Flashy Cooler
    └── Your theme's folder
        ├── theme.json
        ├── preview.jpeg
        └── index.html
```

In the following sections, we'll discuss these one by one.
