## File format

- The preview image **must** be a JPEG.
- Its dimensions must be 480px x 480px.

## Theme Store tips

The preview image doesn't _need_ to be a screenshot of the theme in-action. As long as it's representative of what the theme does, it can be as creative as you'd like it to do. This is fairly subjective, but make sure that it accurately conveys what the theme does and what it looks like.

A great way to do this is to include UI elements of the theme, use the same colour scheme, etc.
